# GV-PostProcessors
 PostProcessing Scripts for Cura

As I work on these I update the Git page.  The versions here should work as intended.  Since I am a one-man-band there may be bugs that I did not catch.  Let me know if there are issues with the post processors.
Known Issues:
MultiExtruderColorMix:
    I don't own a multi-extruder machine so this script might not work as expected.  I could use feedback on this one.
Filament Change:
    I added all the possible parameters as listed on MarlinFW.org.  The parameters must be supported in the firmware.  If they are not then the parameter is likely to be ignored, but it is possible that an invalid parameter will keep the command from being executed.
