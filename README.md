 PostProcessing Scripts for Cura

As I work on these I update the Git page.  The versions here should work as intended.  Since I am a one-man-band there may be bugs that I did not catch.  Let me know if there are issues with the post processors.

Known Issues:

MultiExtruderColorMix:
    I don't own a multi-extruder machine so this script might not work as expected.  I could use feedback on this one.
	
Filament Change:.
    I added all the possible parameters as listed on MarlinFW.org.  The parameters must be supported in the firmware.  If they are not then the parameter is likely to be ignored, but it is possible that an invalid parameter will keep the command from being executed.
	
Flash Forge IDEX Tool Temps:
    This started out as a simple attempt to change the syntax of the Cura Gcode to be acceptable to the Flash Forge IDEX printers.  It ended up being a pretty full-fledged translator and allows the user to select the mode "Normal, Duplicate, or Mirror" in the post processor settings and when the file is saved the gcode is translated and some lines added so the Flash Forge printer will print it as it should.  Just because the Cura gcode opened in FlashPrint seems to be correct doesn't mean that it will print correctly.  This is another one that I need feedback on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a list of the post-processors and a brief description of what they do.

AAA Post Process ReadMe.py:
	When loaded into Cura it will immedeately open the PDF file of the same name.  The PDF has descriptions of all the Cura post processors.  Maintaining it is difficult but I do update it from time to time.  There doesn't seem to be mistakes in it, but there might be new post-processors missing.

AddCoolingProfile.py:
	This one is now included with Cura.  If gives fine control over the layer cooling fan(s) either "By Layer" or "By Feature".

AddCuraSettings:
	Adds a list of over 600 Cura settings to the end of the gcode file.  The exact number depends on the number of extruders, whether certain settings are checked, etc.  It was turned down by the Cura team as being too difficult to maintain.  I see their point, but it is useful to have sometimes none the less.  The current version has been updtated to Cura 5.8-beta.

AlterZHops:
	This allows the Z-hop height to be altered for ranges of layers.  Setting the new hop height to "0" effectively turns it off although the lines are not removed from the gcode.

AnnealingCoolDown:
	Allows "End-of-print" control of the bed (and chamber) temperatures.  The bed temperature can be adjusted and the "cool down" can be stretched out to "anneal" a print.  The print head can be parked out of the way so a cover can be placed over the print.

BridgeTemperatureAdjustment:
	Allows a temperature change for bridging and then returns the temperature to the normal print temperature when the bridge is finished.

CuraPrependBugFix:
	This is specifically for Cura 5.7.2 and removes the temperature prepend lines that are being erroneously entered before the StartUp Gcode.
	
DiscoverSettings:
    NOTE:  This does not generate a gcode file.
	Goes through "fdmprinter.def.json" and retrieves all the settings and pastes them into the gcode file.  If a comparison between two Cura versions is being made then it lists all the settings in each version and reports the differences between the two versions.  This is what I use to update "AddCuraSettings".

DisplayInfoOnLCD
	Now included in Cura, it adds some info to the LCD and can bounce that information back to a print server like OctoPrint or PrintRun.

EmulateMultiExtruder:
	This allows a user to slice a file with a dual extruder printer active and then exchange the Tool Changes for PauseAtLayer and print the gcode on a single extruder printer.  The user becomes the tool changer.  This can get very old very fast but occasionally it's handy to have.

FilamentChange:
	This is a re-write of the Cura version.  It may get accepted into Cura.  I've added all the possible parameters and some firmware may not like that.

FlashForge_IDEX_TempTools:
	Allows users to pick the print mode and to convert a Cura Gcode to a FlashPrint gcode.  This is a work in process.

HighTempPrinting:
	A workaround for the Cura 365Â° temperature limit of the hot end.  When printing a material like PEEK the user enters 1/2 print temperature values and the post-processor will double them in the gcode.

InsertAtLayerChange:
	A re-write with added options such as "Frequency" of the insertion.

LimitXYAccelJerk:
	For bed slinger printers, the accel can be changed at a layer, or gradually changed across a range of layers.  It can keep jerky motion of tall prints from breaking the print loose from the bed.

LittleUtilities_v20
	A collection of about 20 post processors ranging from "Remove Comments" (usefull for UM2 printers) to unloading filament at the end of a print.  There are some script debugging tools as well.

MultiExtruderColorMix:
	A work in process.  This is intended to allow graduated mixing for printers with mixing hot ends.  The Marlin side is well along.  The RepRap side is just started.

PauseAtLayer:
	My re-work of PauseAtHeight.  Allows for unloading, purging, and re-loading and other new options.  There is an option to add pauses to all the models in a "One at a Time" project. 

Raise3DIDEX:
	Does for the Raise3D IDEX machines what the other post does for the Flash Forge IDEX machines.

RetractContinue:
	A re-work to allow the script to work with z-hops and relative extrusion.

SearchAndReplace:
	Another re-write with new options including "First Instance Only" and ranges of layers.

SuptIntMaterialChange:
	This one is really cool.  With the air-gap over the support-interface (or raft) at "0" the user can select the layers to insert filament changes just for the Support-Interface.  After the interface is printed there is another pause to change back to the original material.  (Using PETG for the interface of a PLA print, or vice-versa, works well.)  This allows for excellent release of the support from the model and excellent finishes on the support side of the "first layer over support".  The downside is that as good as it is with large flats, it's value decreases as the number of pauses required grows which makes it annoying for things like the support in large horizontal holes.  But if you have a box top and it needs to be printed riht-side-up, this is really good.

TimeLapse:
	A re-write that has been submitted to UM.  It includes additional options like "Frequency" of the insertion.

Plugin Extensions for Cura
SovolSV04_IDEX
	This is intended to compliment the Sovol SV04 in Cura.  The commands are available in the "Dual Extruder" settings of Cura.
	When it is installed and in "Auto_Mode" it will check the printer name and make an adjustment to 'Copy', 'Dual', 'Mirror', 'Single01', or Single02 mode.  In Dual Mode there are options for single use 'StartUp' and 'Ending' macros.
	
FlashForge_IDEX_Plugin
	Same as the post-processor but as a plugin/extension

Support Interface Material Change
	This is the same as the post-processor.  It is available in the normal Cura settings under 'Enable Support Interface'
	
Zhop On Travel
	Adds Z-hops to a file within a range of layers based on the length of a travel move.  The hop height and minimum travel are user defined.  This is not dependent on retractions and is compatible with Z-Hops enabled in Cura.  It is not compatible with One-at-a-Time mode.
