# GV-PostProcessors
 PostProcessing Scripts for Cura

As I work on these I update the Git page.  The versions here should work as intended.  Since I am a one-man-band there may be bugs that I did not catch.  Let me know if there are issues with the post processors.

Known Issues:

MultiExtruderColorMix:
    I don't own a multi-extruder machine so this script might not work as expected.  I could use feedback on this one.
	
Filament Change:
    I added all the possible parameters as listed on MarlinFW.org.  The parameters must be supported in the firmware.  If they are not then the parameter is likely to be ignored, but it is possible that an invalid parameter will keep the command from being executed.
	
Flash Forge IDEX Tool Temps:
    This started out as a simple attempt to change the syntax of the Cura Gcode to be acceptable to the Flash Forge IDEX printers.  It ended up being a pretty full-fledged translator and allows the user to select the mode "Normal, Duplicate, or Mirror" in the post processor settings and when the file is saved the gcode is translated and some lines added so the Flash Forge printer will print it as it should.  Just because the Cura gcode opened in FlashPrint seems to be correct doesn't mean that it will print correctly.  This is another one that I need feedback on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a list of the post-processors and a brief description of what they do.

AAA Post Process ReadMe.py:
	When loaded into Cura it will immedeately open the PDF file of the same name.  The PDF has descriptions of all the Cura post processors.  Maintaining it is difficult but I do update it from time to time.  There doesn't seem to be mistakes in it, but there might be new post-processors missing.

AddCoolingProfile.py:
	This one is now included with Cura.  If gives fine control over the layer cooling fan(s) either "By Layer" or "By Feature".

AddCuraSettings:
	Adds a list of over 300 Cura settings to the end of the gcode file.  The exact number depends on the number of extruders, whether certain settings are checked, etc.  It was turned down by the Cura team as being too difficult to maintain.  I see their point, but it is useful to have sometimes none the less.

AlterZHops:
	This allows the Z-hop height to be altered for ranges of layers.  Setting the new hop height to "0" effectively turns it off although the lines are not removed from the gcode.

BridgeTemperatureAdjustment:
	Allows a temperature change for bridging and then returns the temperature to the normal print temperature when the bridge is finished.

CuraPrependBugFix:
	This is specifically for Cura 5.7.2 and removes the temperature prepend lines that are being erroneously entered before the StartUp Gcode.

DisplayInfoOnLCD
	Now included in Cura, it adds some info to the LCD and can bounce that information back to a print server like OctoPrint or PrintRun.

EmulateMultiExtruder:
	This allows a user to slice a file with a dual extruder printer active and then exchange the Tool Changes for PauseAtLayer and print the gcode on a single extruder printer.  The user becomes the tool changer.  This can get very old very fast but occasionally it's handy to have.

FilamentChange:
	This is a re-write of the Cura version.  It may get accepted into Cura.  I've added all the possible parameters and some firmware may not like that.

FlashForge_IDEX_TempTools:
	Allows users to pick the print mode and to convert a Cura Gcode to a FlashPrint gcode.  This is a work in process.

HighTempPrinting:
	A workaround for the Cura 365Â° temperature limit of the hot end.  When printing a material like PEEK the user enters 1/2 print temperature values and the post-processor will double them in the gcode.

InsertAtLayerChange:
	A re-write with added options

LimitXYAccelJerk:
	For bed slinger printers, the accel can be changed at a layer, or gradually changed across a range of layers.  It can keep jerky motion of tall prints from breaking the print loose from the bed.

LittleUtilities_v20
	A collection of about 20 post processors ranging from "Remove Comments" (usefull for UM2 printers) to unloading filament at the end of a print.  There are some script debugging tools as well.

MultiExtruderColorMix:
	A work in process.  This is intended to allow graduated mixing for printers with mixing not ends.  The Marlin side is well along.  The RepRap side is just started.

PauseAtLayer:
	My re-work of PauseAtHeight.  Allows for unloading, purging, and re-loading and other new options.

Raise3DIDEX:
	Does for the Raise3D IDEX machines what the other post does for the FLash Forge IDEX machines.

RetractContinue:
	A re-work to allow the script to work with z-hops and relative extrusion.

SearchAndReplace:
	Another re-write with new options including "First Instance Only" and ranges of layers.

SuptIntMaterialChange:
	This one is so cool it's disgusting.  With the air-gap over the support-interface (or raft) at "0" the user can select the layers to insert filament changes just for the Support-Interface.  After the interface is printed there is another pause to change back to the original material.  This allows for excellent release of the support from the model and excellent finishes on the support side of the "first layer over support".  The downside is that as good as it is with large flats, it's value decreases as the number of pauses reqauired grows.

TimedCoolDown:
	Allows the cooling of the build plate (and build volume) to be stretched out to "anneal" a print.

TimeLapse:
	A re-write that has been submitted to UM.  It includes additional options.
