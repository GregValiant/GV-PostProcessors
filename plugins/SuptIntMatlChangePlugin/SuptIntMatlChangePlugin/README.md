This Plugin is new in March of 2024.

This plugin adds a setting named "Support-Interface Mat'l Change" to the Support settings in the Custom print setup of Cura. It allows a user to change to support interface material and then revert to the model material.

**This plugin assumes that a pause command will work with your printer.**

The SuptIntMatlChange settings can be found in the Custom print setup by using the Search field on top of the settings. If you want to make the setting permanently visible in the sidebar, right click and select "Keep this setting visible".

***WARNING***
There must be a ";TYPE:SUPPORT-INTERFACE" comment on each layer that is specified.  Two pauses (to change to interface material and then revert to model material) will be added for each specified layer.  Take care to only include the top interface layer numbers.  This works very well for large flat supported surfaces.  Not so good for horizontal holes as too many pauses can be highly annoying.

## Options

        Enable Support Interface Mat'l Change : Activate the change settings.
