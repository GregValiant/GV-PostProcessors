This Plugin is new in December of 2024.

This plugin adds two or three settings below "Enable Firmware Retraction" in the machine_settings.
**Configure G10/G11:**
    Is dependent on 'Firmware Retraction' being enabled.  When checked it enables the script.
**Z-hops (T0):**
    Enables Z-hops via G10 or sets them to 0.  The Hop Height used is from the Cura Travel Settings.  It will be necessary to enable Zhops in Cura to change the hop height setting.  Z-hops in the Travel settings may then be disabled once again.
**Z-hops (T1):**
    Added if the machine is multi-extruder.  It works the same as noted above but for the second extruder.
