This Plugin is new in January of 2025.

This plugin adds two settings above "Print Speed" in the speed_settings.
**Enable Volumetric Speed Control:**
    Enables the script and allows the user to input their preferred Max Flow Rate and the script will determine the Max Speed for the E motor.
**Max Flow Rate:**
    The maximum speed that the printer works well at.  The E motor will be limited to the speed derived from the flow rate.  The calculation is based on the nozzle size and the filament size.
